# espflash

Serial flasher utility for Espressif SoCs and modules.

Currently supports the **ESP32**, **ESP32-C3**, **ESP32-S2**, **ESP32-S3**, and **ESP8266**.

## Installation

```shell
$ cargo install espflash
```

Alternatively, you can use [cargo-binstall] to install pre-compiled binaries on any supported system. Please check the [releases] to see which architectures and operating systems have pre-compiled binaries.

```shell
$ cargo install cargo-binstall
$ cargo binstall espflash
```

## Usage

```text
espflash 1.7.0

USAGE:
    espflash [OPTIONS] [ARGS] [SUBCOMMAND]

ARGS:
    <SERIAL>    Serial port connected to target device
    <IMAGE>     ELF image to flash

OPTIONS:
        --bootloader <BOOTLOADER>
            Path to a binary (.bin) bootloader file

        --dtr <DTR> [only available when built with the "raspberry" feature]
            DTR pin to use for the internal UART hardware. Uses BCM numbering

        --erase-otadata
            Erase the OTADATA partition This is useful when using multiple OTA partitions and still
            wanting to be able to reflash via espflash

    -f, --flash-freq <FREQUENCY>
            Flash frequency [possible values: 12M, 15M, 16M, 20M, 24M, 26M, 30M, 40M, 48M, 60M, 80M]

        --format <FORMAT>
            Image format to flash [possible values: bootloader, direct-boot]

    -h, --help
            Print help information

        --log-level <LOG_LEVEL>
            Log level [env: LOG_LEVEL=] [default: info]

    -m, --flash-mode <MODE>
            Flash mode to use [possible values: QIO, QOUT, DIO, DOUT]

        --monitor
            Open a serial monitor after flashing

        --monitor-speed <MONITOR_SPEED>
            Baud rate at which to read console output

        --partition-table <PARTITION_TABLE>
            Path to a CSV file containing partition table

        --ram
            Load the application to RAM instead of Flash

        --rts <RTS> [only available when built with the "raspberry" feature]
            RTS pin to use for the internal UART hardware. Uses BCM numbering

    -s, --flash-size <SIZE>
            Flash size of the target [possible values: 256KB, 512KB, 1MB, 2MB, 4MB, 8MB, 16MB, 32MB,
            64MB, 128MB]

        --speed <SPEED>
            Baud rate at which to flash target device

        --use-stub
            Use RAM stub for loading

    -V, --version
            Print version information

SUBCOMMANDS:
    board-info            Display information about the connected board and exit without
                              flashing
    help                  Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)
    partition-table       Operations for partitions tables
    save-image            Save the image to disk instead of flashing to device
    serial-monitor        Open the serial monitor without flashing
    write-bin-to-flash    Writes a binary file to a specific address in the chip's flash
```

## Compile-time features

 - `raspberry`: enables configuring DTR and RTS GPIOs which are necessary to use a Raspberry Pi's
   internal UART peripherals. This feature is optional (external USB <-> UART converters work
   without it) and adds a dependency on [`rppal`](https://crates.io/crates/rppal).

## Configuration

You can also specify the serial port and/or expected VID/PID values by setting them in the configuration file. This file is in different locations depending on your operating system:

| Operating System | Configuration Path                                                       |
| :--------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Linux:**       | `/home/alice/.config/espflash/espflash.toml`                             |
| **Windows:**     | `C:\Users\Alice\AppData\Roaming\esp\espflash\espflash.toml`              |
| **macOS:**       | `/Users/Alice/Library/Application Support/rs.esp.espflash/espflash.toml` |

An example configuration file may look as follows (note that TOML does _not_ support hexadecimal literals):

```toml
[connection]
serial = "/dev/ttyUSB0"

[[usb_device]]
vid = "303A"
pid = "8000"
```

## WSL2

It is not possible to flash `usb-serial-jtag` chips with `WSL2` because the reset also resets `serial-jtag-peripheral` which disconnects the chip from WSL2.

## Use as a Cargo Runner

You can also use `espflash` as a Cargo runner by adding the followin to your project's `.cargo/config` file:

```
[target.'cfg(all(target_arch = "xtensa", target_os = "none"))']
runner = "espflash --ram /dev/ttyUSB0"
```

This then allows you to run your project using `cargo run`.
